# Bayesian machine learning in astronomy: Investigating and comparing methods

In this project, we'd like to compare the advantages and disadvantages of different methods for approximate Bayesian ML, while learning a lot about how to implement Bayesian ML methods in the process. Which have the best uncertainty properties? Which are the most practical? And how can we implement them in libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch?
